bou. ya. cha.

I wrote this with one thing to fix ( copy( thing) instead of thing.copy())
I am happy with this result

This is literally just Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
Which is great, that's exactly what I want to be asked


Wait. Actually, I feel like just doing a breadth-first search will be sufficient, and easier to implement?
just keep a(n unordered) queue of the frontier
